			<h4>A BIT (MORE) ABOUT ME:</h4>
		</div>
		<p className="w3-xlarge w3-text-grey">Growing up you would most
			likely find Justin in the practice room or marching band field, where
			he learned hard work and perseverance from some of the top educators
			in the world. From select ensembles throughout high school and
			college to lugging a 30 pound tuba all over the field with the top
			drum corps in the world, music has always been a part of Justin’s
			identity.</p>

		<p>After graduating from Truman State University with a degree in
			Music – Liberal Arts, Justin took a full-time job directing and
			technical directing the evening news at KTVO-TV in Kirksville, MO,
			which led him on an interesting journey across the country and set
			him down the path to over 15 years of experience in all aspects of
			video and television production.</p>

		<p>From Kirksville, Justin quickly moved to Tyler, TX and then
			South Bend, IN but jumped at the chance to return home to a dream job
			at FOX2-KTVI. For 8 years, Justin directed the 6pm and 10pm newscasts
			on FOX2 and was instrumental in creating a new show called the News
			Edge, a twist on a traditional newscast that required intense
			coordination between the talent, producer, director, and technical
			staff.</p>

		<p>As the modern newsroom changed, Justin embraced the opportunity
			to learn other positions including editing, writing, and eventually
			producing. Moving up to eventually produce the market leading 7am
			newscast for a year and half. The 7am newscast was the second highest
			rated morning show in the St. Louis market and the 5th highest rated
			newscast for all day parts in the entire market.</p>

		<p>Realizing that producing segments was the thing Justin truly
			enjoyed, he decided to take a leap and move to telling important
			stories on The Nine Network of Public media’s flagship public affairs
			television program, Stay Tuned. For two years, Justin was responsible
			for all aspects of the show that brought public affairs programing
			into the 21st century.</p>

		<p>Outside the office, Justin enjoys freelancing at venues across
			the St. Louis area, getting a little too into directing games for the
			Saint Louis University Billikens basketball teams, cheering on Notre
			Dame on Saturdays, sitting on the couch watching ghost shows with his
			wife, Lindsay, and snuggling with his four legged family (a puggle
			named Morgan, a chihuahua/pug named Bridget, and two Orange Tabby
			cats, Jack and Frankie).</p>
